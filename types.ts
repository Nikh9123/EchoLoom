/**
 * 
The NextApiResponseServerIo type is a custom type definition that extends the NextApiResponse type provided by Next.js. It introduces additional properties related to Socket.IO integration. Let's break down the type definition:

typescript
Copy code
export type NextApiResponseServerIo = NextApiResponse & {
  socket: Socket & {
    server: NetServer & {
      io: SocketIOServer;
    };
  };
};
NextApiResponseServerIo Type:

Extends NextApiResponse: This type extends the NextApiResponse type, meaning it inherits all the properties and methods of the standard Next.js API response.
Additional Properties:

socket Property:

This property represents the Socket object associated with the response.
Why? It allows access to the underlying Socket.IO functionality for handling real-time communication.
server Property:

This property represents the NetServer object associated with the response socket.
Why? It gives access to the HTTP server, which is required for setting up the Socket.IO server.
io Property:

This property represents the SocketIOServer instance associated with the HTTP server.
Why? It provides access to the Socket.IO server instance, allowing customization and interaction with Socket.IO features.
